What's new in 2.1
Larger Dataset
New approach to dividing dataset, now includes test split in 70:20:10 split
Includes ability to specify directory for outputs
Incudes new testing section which utilises model.evaluate() and saves the results as txt.

What's new in 2.2
sklearn import for confusion matrix
Confusion matrix
save model

2.3 is a testing program, so no 'what's new'
how 2.3 works:
establishes model, dataset and output directories
loads model using load_model()
loads test dataset using image_dataset_from_directory()
tests model using model.predict()
calculates and stores metrics
generates and stores confusion matrix
displays and saves 9 random images along with their true and predicted labels

what's new in 2.4:
created data augmentation layer
included this layer within model definition

what's new in 2.5
expanded model architecture - new 512 node conv2d layer, new 256 node dense layer
