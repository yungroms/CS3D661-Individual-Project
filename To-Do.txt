Re-draft milestone 1

Testing - Create a test dataset of 10 images for each class from the internet. Write code to test the model using these images.
Changed to 5/class. Need to add to report. Either at the end of model development testing or in designated testing section.

Create a confusion matrix, classification report, image board with predicted/true labels, other metrics. Pray for good results
Evaluation - Evaluate the application functionality. De-bug as much as possible. Much more needed here.
